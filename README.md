# UIS2

## Overview:
    This repository contains the data, scripts, and computational models used in the study titled
    "Mechanistic Insights into Plasmodium eIF2alpha Dephosphorylation by UIS2 via Computation Methods."
    The study focuses on understanding the role of the Plasmodium phosphatase UIS2 in dephosphorylating
    eIF2alpha at Ser59, a critical process for Plasmodium development and infectivity.

## Contents:

### Screening and expression:
1. PlasmoGEM Phenotype Screening Data:
  Used to analyze the essentiality of UIS2 and other translation initiation factors in Plasmodium.
2. Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data:
  From the Malaria Cell Atlas, detailing UIS2 expression across different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle.
3. Data Analysis Scripts:
  Scripts are provided for analyzing the PlasmoGEM phenotype data and single-cell transcriptomics data.
  Use the provided Python scripts to reproduce the scatter plots and UMAP visualizations.

### Protein Structure Modeling:
1. AlphaFold scripts for modeling the UIS2 phosphatase domain and its interaction with eIF2alpha.
2. PyMOL can be used for visualizing the structural models.

### Molecular Docking:
1. Scripts for docking studies using AutoDock Vina, specifically         examining salubrinal binding to UIS2.

### Requirements:
- Python: For data analysis and visualization.
- AlphaFold 2.3.1: For protein structure predictions.
- AutoDock Vina: For molecular docking studies.
- PyMOL: For visualizing protein structures and docking results.
